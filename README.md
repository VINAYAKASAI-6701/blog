# My Blog
Vinay's Blog
A simple Django blog application where users can view a list of posts and click to read full content.

Project Overview
This is a basic blog application built with Django. It displays blog posts on the homepage and provides a detailed view of each post when clicked.

Key Features:
Homepage: Displays a list of all blog posts with a preview.

Detailed Post View: Clicking on a post redirects to a page displaying the full content of that post.

Responsive Design: Adjusts the layout for mobile and desktop views.

How It Works
Models:

The blog uses a Post model with the following fields:

title: The title of the post.

body: The content of the post.

created_at: Timestamp when the post is created.

Views:

index: Fetches all blog posts from the database and passes them to the homepage template (index.html).

post: Fetches a single post by its ID (primary key) and renders the detailed post template (post.html).

URLs:

The project defines two main routes in urls.py:

/: Displays all posts using the index view.

/post/<str:pk>: Displays a single post based on its ID.

Templates:

index.html: Displays a list of posts with the title, creation date, and a truncated preview of the body.

post.html: Displays the full content of a specific post when clicked.
